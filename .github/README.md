### 4. Release Automation (`release.yml`)

**Triggers:** Git tags (`v*.*.*`), Manual workflow dispatch

**Purpose:** Automated release creation with full validation and artifact generation.

**Jobs:**
- **Validate Release:** Version validation, changelog extraction
- **Pre-Release Tests:** Full test suite execution
- **Build Artifacts:** Source archives, Docker images
- **Release Security:** Final security validation
- **Create Release:** GitHub release with artifacts
- **Deploy Staging:** Optional staging deployment
- **Notify Release:** PR comments, release notifications
- **Cleanup on Failure:** Automatic cleanup of failed releases

**Key Features:**
- üì¶ Multi-platform Docker image publishing
- üìã Automatic changelog extraction
- üîí Security scanning before release
- üè∑Ô∏è Semantic version validation
- üöÄ Staging deployment automation
- üí¨ Automatic PR notifications

## üîß Configuration

### Environment Variables

```yaml
NODE_VERSION: '18'          # Node.js version for all workflows
POSTGRES_VERSION: '15'     # PostgreSQL version for testing
REGISTRY: ghcr.io          # Container registry
```

### Required Secrets

- `GITHUB_TOKEN` - Automatically provided by GitHub
- `CODECOV_TOKEN` - Optional, for test coverage reporting

### Required Permissions

```yaml
permissions:
  contents: read/write      # Repository access
  packages: write           # Container registry
  security-events: write   # Security tab integration
  actions: read             # Workflow access
```

## üìã Usage Examples

### Running Security Scans

```bash
# Trigger manual security scan
gh workflow run security.yml

# Run specific scan type
gh workflow run security.yml -f scan_type=dependencies
gh workflow run security.yml -f scan_type=containers
gh workflow run security.yml -f scan_type=secrets
```

### Creating Releases

```bash
# Automatic release from tag
git tag v1.0.0
git push origin v1.0.0

# Manual release creation
gh workflow run release.yml -f tag=v1.0.0 -f pre_release=false
```

### Local Development

```bash
# Run tests locally (matches CI)
make test

# Run security scan locally
make security

# Lint code
make lint

# Build Docker images
make build
```

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Features

### Vulnerability Detection
- NPM audit for dependencies
- Container image scanning with Trivy
- Secret detection with Gitleaks
- Custom pattern matching for sensitive data

### Automated Responses
- Automatic issue creation for high/critical vulnerabilities
- PR blocking for security failures
- SARIF upload to GitHub Security tab
- Daily security monitoring reports

### Best Practices
- Principle of least privilege for workflow permissions
- Artifact retention policies (30-90 days)
- Secure secret handling
- Audit trail for all deployments

## üìä Monitoring & Reporting

### Job Summaries
Each workflow provides detailed summaries with:
- Test results and coverage metrics
- Security scan outcomes
- Deployment status
- Performance metrics

### Artifacts
- Test coverage reports
- Security scan results
- Build artifacts and checksums
- Container images

### Notifications
- PR status comments
- Security alert issues
- Release announcements
- Deployment confirmations

## üö® Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**1. Test Failures**
```bash
# Check PostgreSQL service status
# Verify environment variables
# Review test artifacts
```

**2. Security Scan Failures**
```bash
# Run npm audit fix locally
# Update vulnerable dependencies
# Check for false positives
```

**3. Docker Build Issues**
```bash
# Verify Dockerfile syntax
# Check base image availability
# Review build context
```

**4. Release Failures**
```bash
# Verify tag format (v1.0.0)
# Check changelog format
# Ensure all tests pass
```

### Getting Help

1. Check workflow run logs in GitHub Actions tab
2. Review job summaries for quick diagnostics
3. Download artifacts for detailed analysis
4. Check security tab for vulnerability details
