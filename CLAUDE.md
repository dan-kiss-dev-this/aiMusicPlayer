- **Color Palette**: Applied mint (#D8F2D5), forest-green (#1F4E23), and teal (#389E9D) color scheme
- **Typography**: Integrated Montserrat (headings) and Open Sans (body) font families
- **Professional Layout**: Created radio station-style interface with hero section and grid layout

#### Files Modified:
- `public/index.html` - Complete structural overhaul
- `public/styles.css` - Full Radio Calico styling implementation
- `RadioCalicoLogoTM.png` - Logo asset integration

### Phase 2: Layout Restructuring
**Objective**: Match professional radio station design from reference screenshot

#### Key Features Implemented:
- **Hero Section**: Gradient backgrounds with Radio Calico branding
- **Main Grid Layout**: Professional radio station interface structure
- **Navigation System**: Clean header with logo and navigation elements
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach with CSS Grid and Flexbox

#### Design Decisions Made by AI:
- Interpreted layout requirements without direct screenshot access
- Created professional radio station aesthetic based on industry standards
- Implemented responsive breakpoints for optimal viewing on all devices

### Phase 3: Recent Songs Tracking System
**Objective**: Implement comprehensive 5-song history tracking with dual UI displays

#### Core Functionality:
- **Song History Management**: Automatic tracking of 5 most recent songs
- **Dual Display System**: 
  - Sidebar "Recent Songs" section
  - "Recently Played" widget under Now Playing
- **Smart Rotation**: Automatic removal of oldest songs when limit exceeded
- **Real-time Updates**: Synchronized updates across both UI locations
- **Persistent Storage**: localStorage integration for session persistence

#### Technical Implementation:
```javascript
// Key data structure
let songHistory = []; // Max 5 songs
const MAX_SONG_HISTORY = 5;

// Core functions
- addToSongHistory(song)
- updateRecentTracksUI()
- updateRecentSongsWidget()
- loadSongHistory()
```

#### Files Modified:
- `public/script.js` - Added comprehensive song tracking system
- `public/index.html` - Added recent songs widget HTML structure
- `public/styles.css` - Styled both recent songs displays

### Phase 4: Now Playing Enhancement
**Objective**: Transform Now Playing section to show actual current song information

#### Key Improvements:
- **Current Song Display**: Shows actual track title and artist instead of "not tracking playing"
- **Dynamic Updates**: Automatically updates when new songs are added to history
- **Page Title Integration**: Updates browser tab title with current song
- **Fallback Handling**: Graceful display when no song history exists

#### Functions Added:
```javascript
- setCurrentPlayingSong()
- simulateNewSong()
- testRecentSongsSystem()
```

### Phase 5: UI Layout Optimization
**Objective**: Optimize album art placement and remove unnecessary elements

#### Major Changes:
- **Album Art Relocation**: Moved from Now Playing to Radio Player area as centerpiece
- **Size Enhancement**: Increased album art to 300px × 300px (desktop)
- **Responsive Scaling**: 
  - Tablet: 200px × 200px
  - Mobile: 150px × 150px
- **Video Element Removal**: Replaced with audio element for cleaner interface
- **Audio Controls**: Maintained play/pause functionality with native browser controls

#### Visual Impact:
- Created focal point with large, prominent album art
- Streamlined Now Playing section for better information display
- Enhanced user experience with hover effects and smooth transitions

## AI Development Patterns & Strategies

### 1. **Iterative Development Approach**
- **Small, Focused Changes**: Each modification was targeted and specific
- **Immediate Testing**: Changes were tested after each implementation
- **Error Recovery**: Quick identification and resolution of CSS/JS issues

### 2. **User-Centric Design**
- **Responsive First**: Mobile and desktop considerations in every change
- **Accessibility**: Proper semantic HTML and ARIA considerations
- **User Experience**: Smooth transitions, hover effects, and intuitive layouts

### 3. **Code Quality Maintenance**
- **Consistent Naming**: Clear, descriptive variable and function names
- **Comprehensive Logging**: Detailed console output for debugging
- **Modular Functions**: Separate functions for different UI components

### 4. **Problem-Solving Methodology**
- **Context Gathering**: Reading existing code before making changes
- **Multi-file Coordination**: Ensuring HTML, CSS, and JS work together
- **Cross-browser Compatibility**: Using standard web technologies

## Testing & Debugging Tools Created

### Console Functions for Development:
```javascript
// Show placeholder data
showPlaceholderData()

// Test song history system
testRecentSongsSystem()

// Clear all song history
clearAllSongHistory()

// Simulate new song detection
simulateNewSong()
```

### Debug Features:
- **Comprehensive Logging**: Detailed console output for all operations
- **Visual Feedback**: Real-time UI updates with smooth animations
- **Error Handling**: Graceful fallbacks for missing elements or data
